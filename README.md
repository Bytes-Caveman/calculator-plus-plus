### About

Calculator++ is useless compared to most other calculators and has practically no use in life whatsoever, it is simply just a fun project to practice and apply new C++ coding skills to! Calculator will automatically remove any extra characters (such as double addition signs or accidental letters. For example, typing: '+23 ++ 123 d+ 69420' will result in the calculator calculating: '23+123+69420', this makes it marginally more useful for it's purpose and also massivel- I mean marginally more expensive on your CPU!
